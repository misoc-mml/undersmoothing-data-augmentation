# Undersmoothing Data Augmentation To Reduce Bias for Heterogeneous Causal Effect Estimation from Observational Data

This code accompanies the paper *Undersmoothing Data Augmentation To Reduce Bias for Heterogeneous Causal Effect Estimation from Observational Data*.

The experimental setup is based on the [CATE benchmark](https://github.com/misoc-mml/cate-benchmark) and extended to test our proposed DeGeTs framework.
